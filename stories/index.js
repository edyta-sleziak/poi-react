  "description": "Fall Island B710-176 Immediately off, cut off for two hours either side of HW, Fall is small, steep, rough and high. There is a holiday home on its outside NW end, accessed across the beach by a rough roadway. At LW it is surrounded on three sides by sand. Very beautiful. No camping. Here where the mainland roadway joins the access beach at Cloch Ghlas B712-174 lies the monument to the Skifjord tragedy of 30th October 1981. 6 men were lost when it struck a reef in a storm. 4 of the crew made it ashore in mountainous seas onto Inishinny 1km N. This all came hard for the people of west Donegal after the recent tragedies on Rathlin Oâ€™Birne a handful of years before.",
